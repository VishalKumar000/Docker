TODO: Docker Networking (Host Network)

In Host Network we have only network to be shared like main os, but other than that all things are isolated like volume, images, container

docker container run -itd --network=host ubuntu
docker container exec -it container_id bash
ifconfig (same output as os ifconfig)


docker network create -d host test
