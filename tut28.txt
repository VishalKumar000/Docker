TODO: Docker Networking (Bridge Network)

Best Practice For new Project to have new Network

    docker network create -d bridge test
    docker container run -it --network test ubuntu:latest

Inner Network communication between container is possible.
But for Inter Network communication we have to map other container port to emp0c3 or NIC.
